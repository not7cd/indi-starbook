Starbook INDI Driver
====================

This package provides the INDI driver for the Vixen Starbook telescope controllers. This driver aims for compatibility
with first generation Starbook.
Starbook 10 is not tested with this driver.

Requirements
------------

+ INDI >= v1.7 (http://www.indilib.org)

	You need to install both indi and indi-devel to build this package.

+ cURL >= v7.58.0 (https://curl.haxx.se/)

    You need to install curl

+ libnova

	You need to install both libnova and libnova-devel to build this package.

Usage
-----

Starbook is easy to hang up. You won't get smooth operation by design.
Driver was written with this in mind so it will put few limitations on user.
Starbook is a state machine, that means it will allow different functions in specified states.
During INIT state it won't react to GOTORADEC commands and will wait for
user to manually enter SCOPE state or by START command.

In later version I expect to implement abstract state machine,
to keep Starbook state and allowed transitions.

Internal HTTP server is very fragile, so any wrong request might break it.
Expect frequent restarts of Starbook.
